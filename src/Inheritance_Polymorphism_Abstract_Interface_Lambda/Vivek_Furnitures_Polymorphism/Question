 Component Specification: Discount

 Component Name

 Type (Class)

 Methods

 Responsibilities

 Calculating the discount on the bero

 Discount

 public double calculateDiscount(Bero bObj)

 This method is used to calculate the discount for the bero objects and return the discount amount

 If the object is SteelBero then the discount should be 10%

 If the object is WoodenBero then the discount should be 15%



 Example:

 If the object is SteelBero, price = 5000, then the discount will be:

 Discount = (price * 10) /100

                = (5000 * 10) / 100

 Discount = 500

 Use a public class UserInterface with the main method to test the application.  In the main method get the customer details as shown in the sample input .

 Get the bero type from the user.

 Note: bero type is case sensitive

 If the bero type is "Steel Bero" then create an object for the SteelBero and invoke the calculatePrice(), and display the returned amount as output (refer sample output)

 If the bero type is "Wooden Bero" then create an object for the WoodenBero and invoke the calculatePrice(), and display the returned amount as output (refer sample output)

 If the bero type is invalid then print "<bero type> is an invalid bero type" and terminate the program.

 Example :

 Total price calculation

 If price = 5000, discount = 500, then the total price will be:

 Total price = price - discount

                   = 5000 - 500

                   = 4500.00

 The total price should end with two digits after the decimal points

 Use System.out.printf("%.2f", totalprice).
