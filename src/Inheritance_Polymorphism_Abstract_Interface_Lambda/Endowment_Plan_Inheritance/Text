If the endowment type is educational, then create an object for the EducationalEndowment and invoke the calculateEndowment(), and display the returned amount as output (refer to sample output)

If the endowment type is health, then create an object for the HealthEndowment and invoke the calculateEndowment(), and display the returned amount as output (refer to sample output)

If the endowment type is invalid then print "<endowment type> is an invalid endowment type" and terminate the program.

Note:

Use System.out.printf("%.2f", endowmentamount).
