Kannan Departmental Store has decided to open its online shopping portal. By automating they can easily enter the customer details, award bonus points and calculate the delivery charge as well.

You as their software consultant have been approached to develop software to implement the functionality of generating the bonus points and calculating the delivery charges.

Component Specification: CustomerDetails

Type(Class)

Attributes

Methods

Responsibilities

CustomerDetails

String customerName

String phoneNumber

String streetName

double billAmount

int distance

Include the getter and setter methods for all the attributes.

Include a public parametrized constructor of five arguments in the following order - customerName, phoneNumber, streetName, billAmount, distance to intialize the values for the CustomerDetails object

Note:The attributes of the CustomerDetails class should be private and the methods should be public.

Write a public interface BonusPoints with an abstract method "double calculateBonusPoints()".

Write a public interface DoorDelivery with an abstract method "double deliveryCharge()".

The above class CustomerDetails should implement the Interfaces BonusPoints and DoorDelivery.

Requirement 1: To calculate the Bonus Points

The application needs to calculate the bonus points to be awarded to the customer based on the bill amount.

Calculating bonus points for the customer

CustomerDetails

public double calculateBonusPoints()

This method should calculate the bonus points to be awarded to the customer based on the bill amount and return the bonus points

If the billAmount is greater than or equal to 250, the customer is eligible to get bonus points

So the bonus points will be calculated as billAmount/10

If the billAmount is less than 250 return 0



Example:

If billAmount = 480, then the Bonus Points will be:

Bonus Points   = billAmount / 10

                        = 480 / 10

                        = 48.0



Requirement 2: To calculate the Delivery charges

The application needs to calculate the delivery charges  to be paid by the customer according to the distance

Component Specification: CustomerDetails

Responsibilities

Calculating delivery charges for the customer

CustomerDetails

public double deliveryCharge()

This method should calculate the delivery charges to be paid by the customer based on the distance and return the delivery charges.

If the distance is greater than or equal to 25, the delivery charges should be Rs 8/km.

If the distance is greater than or equal to 15 and less than 25, the delivery charges should be Rs 5/ km

If the distance is less than 15 km, the delivery charges should be Rs 2/ km

So the delivery charges should be calculated as distance*delivery charges per km



Example:

If distance = 10, then the Delivery  charges will be:

Delivery charges = distance * delivery charges per km

                          = 10 * 2

                          = 20.0

Use a public class UserInterface with the main method to test the application.  In the main method get the customer details as shown in the sample input .

Create an object for CustomerDetails and invoke the calculateBonusPoints() method from the CustomerDetails class to find the bonus points, and display the returned points as output(refer sample output).

Invoke the deliveryCharge() method from the CustomerDetails class to find the delivery charges, and display the returned amount as output(refer sample output).
